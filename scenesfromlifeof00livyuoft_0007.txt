PREFAOE

HANNIBALâ€™S life, as told in the vivid language of
Livy, has been selected as forming an interesting
exception to the almost uniform success of the
Roman arms.

The order of events in Livy has not always been
followed, and considerable modifications in the text
have been sometimes necessary to render it suitable
for beginners. It is hoped that this disadvantage
will be counterbalanced by the attraction that the
character of the hero will have for its readers.

With the same object the notes are full and
explanatory, but rather in construction than in
translation.

Continual reference is made to the very useful
and comprehensive Olarendon Press Elementa&
Latin Grammar by Mr. Allen.

A special index with short accounts of proper
names has been added to facilitate speedy reference.

The English Exercises are based on the Latin
text, and provide one easy and one slightly more
advanced exercise on each section.

1 should like to offer in conclusion my hearty
thanks to the reader of the Clarendon Press for the
many valuable suggestions which he has made.

W. D. LOWE.
