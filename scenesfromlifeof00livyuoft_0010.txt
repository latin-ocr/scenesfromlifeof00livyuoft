6 HISTORICAL INTRODUGTION

expansion and commercial activity. The interests
of the two Powers collided in Sicily, the richest
and most fertile island in the Meditenanean, which
lay, as it happened, midway between Rome and
Carthage and was under the influence of both states:
the wars which followed were due partly to national
antipathy‚ but chiefly to jealousy and commercia]
rivalry. Neither side realized at first that it was to
be a struggle to the death, though it must have been
gradually borne in upon them that it was practically
impossible to expect a satisfactory and definite peace.
Moreover, the struggle seemed likely to be proti-acted,
for Rome relied especially on her army, while the
strength of Carthage lay in her navy: the navy of
Rome was practically non-existent at the beginning
of the third century Β. C„ while the army of Carthage
consisted neither of citizens nor subjects, but of
foreign mercenaries‚ who proved too often unrcliable
and faithless. And here the difference in the charac-
ters of the two nations showed itself: the genius of
Rome triumphed over its difficulty: the defect was
made good, the inefficiency was removed: a fleet
was built and sailors were trained, and after years
of disappointment and defeat at the hands of the
experienced Carthaginian navy Roman determination
and courage were victorious.

On the other hand the evil star of the Carthaginians
was too strong for them: luxury and indolence held
them back from military service, and though a citizen
army might have saved them, they refused to alter
their methods and preferred to rely on mercenary
troops.
