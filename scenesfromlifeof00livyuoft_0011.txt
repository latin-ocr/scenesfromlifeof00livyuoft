War, which resulted in the acquisition by Rome of 264-242
part of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. ΒΩ

Α dispute in Spain was the cause of the second
Punic War, which resulted in the acquisition by Rome 219-202
of the rest of Sicily and part of Spain. EC·

After the losses and humiliation of the first Punic
War Carthage was eager to recoup herself, and one
country especially attracted her. This was Spain.
Spain was practically open country and untouched
land; it had not as yet been annexed by any great
Power. Spain had great mineral wealth and was
likely to prove a useful recruiting ground for the
diminished Carthaginian army. Spain was but a few
miles from Africa and within easy striking distance
of Carthage.

The great Hamilcar Barca himself, at that time
the ablest general of Carthage, still smarting with
resentment at the treacherous annexation of Sardinia
by the Romans, was the originator of the policy of
extending the Carthaginian power in Spain. He
determined to create a power in Spain strong enough
to defy and perhaps ultimately to conquer Rome.
For nearly ten years he devoted himself to his task, 238-229
using all the means at his command. He formed ΕΟ·
alliances with some tribes, won over others, and
crushed those that stubbornly remained host-ile to
him. He developed the mineral resources of the
country and encouraged commerce and intercourse
with the natives, thereby endeavouring to strengthen
Carthaginian influence in the country. Unfortunately
before his work of consolidation was completed he
lost his life on an expedition against some tribes in
the interior.
