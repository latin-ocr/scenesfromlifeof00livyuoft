ends, (originally a ram’s head of brass,) to beat down walls.
Some were carried by soldiers, others were swung back-
wards and soi-wards on a balance. moenibus, dative.
constituit: see note on prolatare, l. 24.

32. arietibus, abl. of the instrument. L. G. 120 (c).

34. nocte, abl. oftime when: L. G. 101. This new wall was
