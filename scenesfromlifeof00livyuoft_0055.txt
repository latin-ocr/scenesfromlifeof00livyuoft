NOTES 51

112. iaculatores: these slingers were light-armed troops
from the Balearic islands; their weapon was the sling
(sunda) with leaden bullets.

113. in subsidiis, ‘in reservo) Livy might have written
subsidiis, the predicative dativo ‘for’‚ or, ‘as a reservo)
frenatos: the Spanish, or heavy—armed cavalry, used bits
and bridles3 the Numidians, or light-armed cavalry, did not
(infrenati).

116. circumvecti ε used here as perf. partic. deponent, sc.
equis, ‘riding round.'

117. a tergo : notice this use of α leryo, α lateribus, α fronte,
‘in the rear‚' ‘wing,' ‘van.' L. G. 348, note. Later we have
ex adverso, l. 173, in a similar construction.

118. auxit: a singular verb with two singular subjects,
vulnus et periculum. L. G. 217, note 1. consulis depends on
vulnus elpericulum, not on pavorem.

120. armis et corporibus, abl. of means.

121. reduxit, sc. eum, i.e. consulem. Livy adds that the
consul was saved by the activity and bravery of his son,
Publius Scipio Africanus, who afterwards won the battle 01
Zama. At this date he was hardly seventeen. The battle
of the Ticinus was really little more than a magnified
cavalry skirmish, and doubtless would have been glozed over
by the Roman historians, had it not, as events proved,
turned out to be the first of the long succession of Hannibal’s
victories over the Roman arms.

VI

Scipi0‚ though reluctant to fight again until he had re-
covered from the wound which he had received in the battle
on the Ticinus, was overpersuaded by his more headstrong
colleague, Sempronius, who had come with reinsorcements
from Sicily. The latter had won a slight advantage over
the Carthaginians in a skirmish and was eager for an
engagement.

123. insidiis, dat. of purpose. L. G. 117 (f). Translate
‘suitable for . . .' circumspectare: see note on prolatare,

128. quibus, abl. of means. Note the final use of the
relative, ‘in order that you may . . . by means os them.'

130. brumae, December, 218 13.c. educti, perf. partic.
pass. capto cibo, abl. abs. Translate ‘though they had not
yet . . . the Romans had to plunge through the icy flood,
