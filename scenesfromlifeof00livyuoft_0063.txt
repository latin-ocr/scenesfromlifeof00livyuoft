NOTES 59

290. pugna. Cannensis. Notice the Latin preference for
adjectives, to avoid one substantive depending on another ;
cf. Alliensi cladi, ‘ battle of Allia‚⁷ 390 13.c.‚ in which tho
Romans were annihilated hythe Gauls and Rome was left at
the mercy of the invading barbarians. It was always held
as a day of ill omen (dies ater) in the calendar.

Hannibal, who had lost 6,ΟΟΟ men in the battle, was still
reluctant to march on Rome ; he knew well his powerless-
ness to attack the mighty walls of the city, and that at his
presence every citizen would become a soldier: morem-er,
he had no siege train. He therefore resolved first to rouse
the Italian states and then attack Rome with all Italy at his
back. At this point Mr. Bosworth Smith sums up Hannibal's
successes : ‘ Four times over, he had now measured his sword
with the future conquerors of the world, and each time he
had been victorious, and that too in an ever-ascending series
of successes. At the Ticinus he first met the Roman cavalry,
and it was their hasty retreat from the field of battle which
alone saved them from a rout. At the Trebia, however the
consul might try to disguise it, it was not retreat at all, but
a total rout. At the Trasimene, it was neither defeat nor
rout, it was the extermination of an army. At Cannae it
was the extermination‚ not of one but of two armies, and
each of them was twice its usual size. This was the pinnacle
of Hannibal’s success, and a pinnacle indeed it was?

verdict of Minucius on Fabius.
