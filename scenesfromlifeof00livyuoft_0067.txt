NOTES 63

369. ad oppugnandam arcem, tho acc. of the gerundivo
after ad. If the verb is transit. the gerundivo is more fre-
quently used than the gerund. ; it agrees with the object as
an adj. and takes the number and gender of the object, but
the object is drawn into the case of the gerund. L. G. 139,
279.

370. cum: for cum causal with the subj. cf. cum, l. 295.
tam . . . ut non .. . posset, consecutive subj„ L. G. 145-6.
Observe wpuynare, ‘to attack by storm,’ expugnare, ‘to take
by storm.’

371. intercipere, prolative infin.

372. Tarentinis, dat. Hannibal had not the time, nor his
impetuous soldiery the patient perseverance‚ to settle down
to a protracted blockade.

374. hiberna, sc. castra. The bait which attracted Hannibal
to Tarentum was partly the wealth of the city and its
jealousy of Rome, but still more its fine harbour, which he
could use for communication with Carthage. The Iax
vigilance of the Roman commander and garrison assured
him of an easy entrance into the town, but all his efforts to
take the strong citadel to which the Romans fied were un-
availing, and though the gai-rison was closely blockaded it
still commanded the harbour, which was thereby rendered
useless to the Carthaginian. Later in the war the Romans
recovered the whole of Tarentum.

to break his way through to relieve Capua and too astute to
risk a battle with that fateful commander.
