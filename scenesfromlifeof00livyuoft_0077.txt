NOTES 73

641. venenum ε some authorities say that he carried the
poison concealed in a ring; a later Latin poet calls the ring
‘the avenger of Cannae and of many a Roman life’: ‘ille
Cannarum vindex et tanti sanguinis ultor anulus)

643. liberemus, plural for singular. cura, abl. of separa-
tion. L. G. 121 (a).

644. quando, rare for cnm, ‘since' tardius, the com-
parative adverb. senis, he was now sixty-three. Though
the Romans pursued Hannibal to the death we must
remember in their favour that he was still an open and
professed enemy of Rome, and as such they were within
their rights in demanding his surrender, and Hannibal was
perhaps equally prudent, according ‘co the moral views on
life in that age, in choosing a voluntary death rather than
to be dragged in triumph through the streets of Rome to
the Capitol, where the same doom doubtless would have
been his sate.
