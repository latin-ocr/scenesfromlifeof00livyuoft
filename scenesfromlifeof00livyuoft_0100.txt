EN GLISH EXERCISES

As these exercises are closely connected with the divisions
of the Latin translation of the sanie number, continual
reference should be made to the corresponding piece of
Latin, as similar constructions will be frequently found
in both, and some assistance may be gained by comparing
the two. The sections in the rules at the head of the
exercises refer to Allen's Latin Grammar. The rules must
in all cases be learnt thoroughly preparatory to attempting
the exercises. Words linked by hyphens are to be trans-
lated by a single Latin word. (The exercises are divided
into classes A, B; Α being easier, Β slightly harder.)
