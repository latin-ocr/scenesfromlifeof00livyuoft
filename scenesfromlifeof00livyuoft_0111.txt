Rums. L. G. 5 317. Wherever it is possible in sentences
in which a Latin participle is to be used make the participle
agree with the subject or object as required in the previous
exercises. (1) ‘The Romans having defeated the Gauls
killed them‚’ i. e. ‘the Romans killed the (having been)
defeated Gauls‚' Romani victos Gallos occiderunt.
(2) ‘ The Gauls were defeated and killed‚’ i. e. ‘the (having
been) defeated Gauls were killed‚‘ Galli victi occidebantur.

Roas. L. G. 5 123. When the participle cannot be
brought into agreement with either subject or object to the
verb. use the ablativo absolute construction, which is formed
by a noun in the ablative with the participle in agreement.
‘ The horse being killed, I will go away‚’ equo occiso, abibo ε
again, if there is no deponent perf. part. this construction
should be used, ‘having heard this news, he went away‚'
his rebus auditis abiit. For different phrases in English
which should be translated into abl. abs. in Latin read
carefully ξ 262, and compare ξ 302.
