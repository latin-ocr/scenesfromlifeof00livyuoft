Reuss. L. G. ξ 135. The gerunds are thes cases of the
infin. The aecus. gerund is used after prep. ‘ born to rule ’,
natusad regendum : the genit. ‘desirous of ruling‘, cupidus
regendi: dat. ‘ devoted to ruling', deditus regendo: abl.
used as abl. of manner or with a prep. ‘he was worn out by
ruling’‚ fessus erat regendo. When the gerund is in the
genit. or abl. it may govern a case, hostem vincendi causa,
‘for the sake of . . . ‚' hostem fugando vicit, ‘he won by
routing the foe.' §279. But when the gei-und governs an
object, it is more usual to put the noun into the case of the
gemnd, and to use the gerundive agreeing in gender, number,
and case with the noun: natus ad regendos populos :
cupidus regendi populi: deditus regendis populis, §5 138,
139, and 279.
